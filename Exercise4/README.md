# Question1
Look at Threshold.cpp and implement the code in Python, and observe the results for different threshold values. Comment on the results. <br />
The first four methods just use different rules to change the pixels below or(and) above some value while keeping the others.<br />
For the adaptive threshold, as the threshold is adaptive, this method always has a better performance. But it needs more compution.
# Question2
What are the disadvantages of binary threshold?<br />
As the values of thresholds are set by users, it's can be hard for users to find a good threshold. Also, it has a bad performance when different parts in the image need different thresholds. For example, in a photo the lights in different parts are always different.
# Question3
When is Adaptive Threshold useful?<br />
When different parts in the image need different threshold.
